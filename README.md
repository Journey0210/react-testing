## RTL (React Testing Library)

    - Creats virtual DOM for testing
    - Allow tesing without a browser
    - Unit tests : very easy to pinpoint failures
    - Integration tests
    - Functional tests : close to how users interact with software, robust tests
    - Acceptance / End to end tests

## Jest

    - Test runner

    https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

## TDD (Test Driven Development)

    - Write tests before writing code
    - red-green testing
    - part of the coding process, not a "chore" to do at the end
